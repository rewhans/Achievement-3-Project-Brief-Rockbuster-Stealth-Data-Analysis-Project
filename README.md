### SQL Project: Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis

This project involved a comprehensive data analysis of Rockbuster Stealth LLC's movie rental data using SQL. The primary goal was to extract meaningful insights to inform the launch strategy of their new online video rental service. By loading the provided dataset into a PostgreSQL database and employing various SQL querying techniques, I addressed key business questions posed by the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.

**Key aspects of this project included:**

* **Database Management:** Setting up a PostgreSQL database and loading the Rockbuster data.
* **Data Exploration:** Developing an understanding of the data schema, identifying relationships between tables, and exploring data types.
* **Business Question Analysis:** Utilizing SQL to answer critical business questions, such as:
    * Identifying movies with the highest and lowest revenue contribution.
    * Calculating the average rental duration of all videos.
    * Determining the geographic distribution of Rockbuster customers.
    * Locating high-lifetime-value customers geographically.
    * Analyzing sales figure variations across different regions.
* **Data Manipulation and Analysis:** Employing various SQL clauses (e.g., `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`, `HAVING`, subqueries, and Common Table Expressions - CTEs) to filter, sort, aggregate, and join data from multiple tables.
* **Data Presentation:** Preparing the results of the SQL analysis for presentation to both business and technical audiences. This involved creating visualizations (potentially using tools like Tableau - see link below if applicable) and compiling a data dictionary.

**Key skills demonstrated:**

* Relational database management (RDBMS) principles.
* Proficiency in writing moderately complex SQL queries.
* Data cleaning and manipulation using SQL.
* Data analysis and interpretation to answer business questions.
* Data visualization and presentation of findings.
